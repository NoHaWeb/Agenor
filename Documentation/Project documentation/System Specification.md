System Specification
--------------------

### 1\. Introduction

The system is a cloud-based file sharing platform developed using Laravel framework for server-side scripting, PHP for dynamic web pages, and MySQL for database management. It aims to provide users with a robust and secure solution for uploading, storing, accessing, and managing files from any device with internet connectivity. The platform includes distinct user roles: Administrator and User, each with specific privileges and access rights tailored to their needs.

### 2\. Architecture Overview

The system follows a three-tier architecture, consisting of a presentation layer, business logic layer, and data persistence layer. Clients interact with the server-side application hosted on a web server, which processes user requests, performs business logic operations, and communicates with the MySQL database to store and retrieve data.

### 3\. User Roles and Privileges

#### 3.1 Administrator

*   Can manage user accounts, including creation, deletion, and modification.
    
*   Has access to system configuration settings and administrative functions, such as setting user permissions and managing system resources.
    
*   Can view logs and monitor system activities for auditing and troubleshooting purposes.
    
*   Has the authority to resolve technical issues and perform maintenance tasks, including database backups and software updates.
    

#### 3.2 User

*   Can upload files to their personal library using a web-based interface.
    
*   Has the ability to view, download, and delete their own files.
    
*   Can share files with other users based on configured permissions, including read-only or read-write access.
    
*   Can customize their profile settings, including profile picture, display name, and contact information.
    

### 4\. Database Schema

#### 4.1 Users Table

*   Stores user account information, including username, email, hashed password, and role.
    
*   Enables authentication and authorization for user access control.
    

#### 4.2 Files Table

*   Stores metadata related to uploaded files, including filename, file size, upload timestamp, owner (user ID), and access permissions.
    
*   Facilitates efficient retrieval and management of user files, supporting CRUD operations.
    

#### 4.3 Logs Table

*   Logs system activities, user actions, and errors for auditing and troubleshooting purposes.
    
*   Captures timestamp, user ID, action type, and additional contextual information for each log entry.
    

### 5\. System Features

#### 5.1 User Authentication

*   Implements secure user authentication mechanism using Laravel's built-in authentication system.
    
*   Utilizes hashed passwords and encryption to ensure confidentiality and integrity of user credentials.
    

#### 5.2 File Management

*   Provides a user-friendly web interface for uploading, organizing, and managing files.
    
*   Supports file browsing, viewing, downloading, and deletion functionalities for registered users.
    
*   Enables users to organize files into folders and subfolders for better organization and navigation.
    

#### 5.3 Access Control

*   Enforces role-based access control (RBAC) to regulate user privileges and restrict unauthorized access to system resources.
    
*   Provides granular access control settings, allowing administrators to define access permissions for individual files and folders.
    

#### 5.4 User Profile Management

*   Enables users to customize their profile settings, including profile picture, display name, and contact information.
    
*   Provides options to update password and email address for account security.
    
*   Allows users to configure notification preferences and privacy settings.
    

#### 5.5 File Sharing

*   Allows users to share files with other registered users through secure sharing links or direct invitations.
    
*   Supports configurable access permissions for shared files, including view-only, edit, and download options.
    
*   Enables users to revoke shared access or update permissions for shared files as needed.
    

### 6\. System Interfaces

#### 6.1 Web Interface

*   Utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the user interface design, with responsive design principles for optimal user experience across devices.
    
*   Provides intuitive navigation and interactive features for seamless file management and collaboration.
    

#### 6.2 API (Application Programming Interface)

*   Offers RESTful API endpoints for integrating with third-party applications and services.
    
*   Enables programmatic access to system functionalities, such as file upload, download, authentication, and user management.
    

### 7\. Security Considerations

#### 7.1 Data Encryption

*   Implements HTTPS encryption to secure data transmission over the network, preventing eavesdropping and tampering.
    
*   Utilizes encryption mechanisms to protect sensitive data stored in the database, such as user credentials and file contents.
    

#### 7.2 Input Validation and Sanitization

*   Validates and sanitizes user inputs to prevent common security vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
    
*   Implements server-side validation for form submissions and file uploads to ensure data integrity and system reliability.
    

#### 7.3 Access Control Measures

*   Enforces strong authentication requirements, including password complexity rules and multi-factor authentication (MFA) options.
    
*   Implements role-based access control (RBAC) to limit user privileges and restrict access to sensitive system resources.
    

### 8\. Deployment and Maintenance

#### 8.1 Deployment Process

*   Deployed on a secure web server environment, utilizing industry-standard security configurations and access controls.
    
*   Implements automated deployment pipelines for continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) to streamline deployment processes and ensure code quality.
    

#### 8.2 Maintenance Procedures

*   Conducts regular security audits and vulnerability assessments to identify and address potential security vulnerabilities.
    
*   Implements proactive monitoring and alerting systems to detect and respond to security incidents in real-time.
    
*   Performs routine backups of system data and configuration files to prevent data loss and facilitate disaster recovery.
