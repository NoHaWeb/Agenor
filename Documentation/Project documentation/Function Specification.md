Overview
--------

The project aims to develop a cloud-based file sharing system that allows users to seamlessly upload files to the cloud and instantly access them from any device or location.

Functional Requirements
-----------------------

### 1\. File Upload

*   Users can drag and drop files into their library within the system.
    
*   Supported file types include documents, images, videos, and other commonly used formats.
    
*   There is no restriction on file size within reasonable limits.
    

### 2\. Cloud Storage

*   Uploaded files are stored securely in the cloud.
    
*   The system should support scalable cloud storage solutions to accommodate varying file sizes and user demands.
    

### 3\. Real-time Sync

*   Upon upload, files are instantly synchronized across all linked devices and the online interface.
    
*   Users should not experience delays in accessing newly uploaded files.
    

### 4\. Cross-Platform Accessibility

*   The system is accessible from any internet-connected device, including desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.
    
*   Compatibility across major operating systems such as Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android is ensured.
    

### 5\. Remote Access

*   Users can access their files from any location with internet connectivity.
    
*   Access is not restricted by geographical boundaries or network environments.
    

### 6\. User Authentication and Authorization

*   Secure login/authentication mechanism to ensure only authorized users can access the system.
    
*   Role-based access control to manage user permissions and privileges.
    

### 7\. User Interface

*   Intuitive and user-friendly interface for easy navigation and file management.
    
*   Responsive design to provide optimal viewing and interaction experience across different devices and screen sizes.
    

### 8\. Notifications

*   Users receive notifications upon successful file uploads and synchronization.
    
*   Optional notifications for system updates, maintenance, or other relevant information.
    

### 9\. Security and Data Privacy

*   Implementation of robust security measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.
    
*   Compliance with industry-standard encryption protocols and data protection regulations.
    

### 10\. Error Handling and Logging

*   Comprehensive error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle unexpected events and errors.
    
*   Logging system to record system activities, user actions, and potential issues for troubleshooting purposes.
    
### 11\. Scenarios

*    When opening the website, the user encounters the login interface for the first time.
  
*    After logging in, files can be uploaded to a field that functions as drag and drop.
  
*    You can search for files that have been shared with us using a search bar.
  
*    In the header of the website, you can select to see which files have been uploaded by the logged-in profile.

*    At the uploaded files there will be possibility of file deletion and modification.
