System Specification
====================

1\. Introduction
----------------

The system is a cloud-based file sharing platform developed using PHP for server-side scripting and MySQL for database management. It provides users with the ability to upload, store, and access files from any device with internet connectivity. The system includes two main user roles: Administrator and User, each with specific privileges and access rights.

2\. Architecture Overview
-------------------------

The system follows a client-server architecture, where clients interact with the server-side application hosted on a web server. PHP is used to handle server-side logic and generate dynamic web pages, while MySQL is utilized as the backend database management system to store user data, file metadata, and access control information.

3\. User Roles and Privileges
-----------------------------

### 3.1 Administrator

*   Can manage user accounts, including creation, deletion, and modification.
    
*   Has access to system configuration settings and administrative functions.
    
*   Can view logs and monitor system activities.
    
*   Has the authority to resolve technical issues and perform maintenance tasks.
    

### 3.2 User

*   Can upload files to their personal library.
    
*   Has the ability to view, download, and delete their own files.
    
*   Can share files with other users based on configured permissions.
    
*   Can customize their profile settings and preferences.
    

4\. Database Schema
-------------------

The MySQL database consists of the following tables:

### 4.1 Users

*   Stores user account information, including username, password (hashed), email, role, and other relevant details.
    
*   Maintains authentication and authorization data for user access control.
    

### 4.2 Files

*   Stores metadata related to uploaded files, such as filename, file size, upload timestamp, owner (user ID), and access permissions.
    
*   Facilitates efficient retrieval and management of user files.
    

### 4.3 Logs

*   Logs system activities, user actions, and errors for auditing and troubleshooting purposes.
    
*   Captures timestamp, user ID, action type, and additional contextual information.
    

5\. System Features
-------------------

### 5.1 User Authentication

*   Implements secure user authentication mechanism using PHP sessions and hashed passwords stored in the database.
    
*   Ensures confidentiality and integrity of user credentials during login process.
    

### 5.2 File Management

*   Allows users to upload files to their personal library using a web-based interface.
    
*   Supports file browsing, viewing, downloading, and deletion functionalities for registered users.
    

### 5.3 Access Control

*   Enforces role-based access control (RBAC) to regulate user privileges and restrict unauthorized access to system resources.
    
*   Administrators have full access rights, while regular users have limited permissions based on their role.
    

### 5.4 User Profile Management

*   Enables users to customize their profile settings, including profile picture, display name, and contact information.
    
*   Provides options to update password and email address for account security.
    

### 5.5 File Sharing

*   Allows users to share files with other registered users through secure sharing links or direct invitations.
    
*   Enables users to set access permissions (e.g., read-only, read-write) for shared files.
    

6\. System Interfaces
---------------------

### 6.1 Web Interface

*   Utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the user interface design.
    
*   Implements responsive web design principles for optimal user experience across desktop and mobile devices.
    

### 6.2 API (Application Programming Interface)

*   Provides RESTful API endpoints for integrating with third-party applications and services.
    
*   Enables programmatic access to system functionalities, such as file upload, download, and authentication.
    

7\. Security Considerations
---------------------------

*   Implements HTTPS encryption to secure data transmission over the network.
    
*   Sanitizes user inputs and utilizes parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
    
*   Implements cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection mechanisms.
    
*   Regularly updates server software and dependencies to mitigate potential security vulnerabilities.
    

8\. Deployment and Maintenance
------------------------------

*   Deployed on a secure web server with appropriate firewall and access control configurations.
    
*   Utilizes version control systems (e.g., Git) for managing source code and facilitating collaboration.
    
*   Implements automated testing and continuous integration (CI) pipelines for ensuring code quality and reliability.
    
*   Regularly backs up database and system configuration files to prevent data loss in case of system failures.
    

9\. Conclusion
--------------

The system specification outlines the architecture, features, and security considerations of the cloud-based file sharing platform developed using PHP and MySQL. By adhering to these specifications, the project aims to deliver a robust, scalable, and secure solution that meets the needs of both administrators and users.
