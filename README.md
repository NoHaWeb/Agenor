***No more postage, unnecessary paper printing.***

All you have to do is drag the file intended for your client into your library and the system will automatically upload it to the cloud, after which it will immediately appear on your partner's computer and on the online interface.<br />

It is accessible from anywhere on any device.

You can access it all from any computer or device, anywhere, at any time, ensuring convenience and flexibility for users regardless of their location or the device they are using.
