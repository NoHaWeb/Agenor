Requirement Specification: Cloud-Based File Sharing Platform
============================================================

Overview
--------

Our organization is in need of a modern and efficient cloud-based file sharing platform to streamline our file management processes and enhance collaboration among team members. The platform should provide secure and convenient access to files from any location or device with internet connectivity.

Current Situation
-----------------

Currently, our organization relies on traditional file storage methods, such as local servers and email attachments, for sharing and accessing files. However, these methods are often cumbersome, leading to inefficiencies, version control issues, and difficulty in accessing files remotely.

Objectives
----------

*   Implement a cloud-based file sharing platform to improve productivity and collaboration within the organization.
    
*   Enable seamless file access from any location or device, ensuring flexibility and convenience for users.
    
*   Enhance data security and privacy through robust authentication, access control, and encryption mechanisms.
    
*   Streamline file management processes, including uploading, sharing, and organizing files, to reduce manual effort and errors.
    

Model of Current Business Processes
-----------------------------------

Currently, our organization follows manual file sharing processes, which involve:

1.  Users creating files locally on their devices or accessing files from shared network drives.
    
2.  Files being attached to emails or transferred via file transfer protocols (FTP) for sharing with team members.
    
3.  Users manually managing file versions and access permissions, leading to potential inconsistencies and conflicts.
    
Model of Demanded Business Processes
------------------------------------

The demanded business processes for the new cloud-based file sharing platform include:

1.  Users uploading files to the platform's cloud storage through a user-friendly web interface or desktop application.
    
2.  Files being securely stored in the cloud and accessible to authorized users based on predefined access permissions.
    
3.  Users sharing files with team members through secure sharing links or direct invitations, with configurable access levels (e.g., view-only, edit).
    
4.  Real-time synchronization of files across devices, ensuring users have access to the latest versions of documents.
    
5.  Administrators managing user accounts, access permissions, and system settings through an administrative dashboard.
